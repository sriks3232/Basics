
- Java is an object oriented programming language developed by James Gosling
  at Sun Microsystems
- Sun Microsystems is acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2010.
- Java is product of Oracle Corp.


Object Oriented Concepts
-------------------------
- Objects
- Classes
- Data Abstraction
- Data Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

Object
------
An object is a real time entity which has identity, state and behavior

	Refer diagram Object.png

Class
-----
- A class is a collection of related objects
- A class is a collection of data members and methods

eg:

class Employee
{
    //Data members
      int empNum;
      String empName;
      double empSalary;
    //Methods
      void setEmpDetails() //void means no return type
      {
	....
	....
      }
      void dispEmpDetails()
      {
	....
	....
      }
}

The members(data members/methods) of the class are accessed using objects
with dot(.) operator

Creating objects
----------------
syntax
------
ClassName objName = new ClassName();

eg:

Employee e = new Employee();//e is an object of class Employee

e.empNum = 111;
e.empName = "Raj";
e.setEmpDetails();
